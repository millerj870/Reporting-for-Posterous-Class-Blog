This repository contains three python scripts:

	report_copmments.py
	report_posts.py
	processing.py

Together, these scripts can be used to 'scrape' a mulit-person Posterous blog for information about postings and comments made by contributors.  The scrips were created to support grading in a course that required student participation in blogging via posterous.  The scripts allowed the teachers to monitor participation without manually paging trough tens and tens of posterous pages and comments.

report_post.py
	This script scrapes author, date, title, and url information for each post on a posterous blog.  It uses the pyposterous Posterous API wrapper, so authentication via posterous username and password is coded into the script as is the name of the site to be examined.  Output is in the form of a text file whose lines correspond to different posts on the page.  Posts will bizzard authorship or unicode charaters in the their fields are skipped.  The script outputs a report in txt format that has the timestamp in its filename.
	
report_comments.py
	This script does for comments on a posterous blog what report_post.py does for posts.  It reports author, date, and url for each comment as well as the title of the post to which a comment responded.  The script outputs a report in txt format that has the timestamp in its filename.
	
processing.py
	This file takes the reports generated by report_post.py and report_comments.py as command-line inputs (in that order) and outputs a LaTeX file displaying the posts and comments organized by author.  This script also has a dictionary that can be used to translate an author's postID to their full name, but that functionality (a single line, basically) is commented out.  The LaTeX output also contains some basic numerical information about all posts and all comments and well as counts of each for each author.  The user must run pdflatex or latex on the output file (tmp.tex) to typeset the file.
